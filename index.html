  <p>My name is Kingsley Elorm Kwaku Leh. I come from Kpoeta Ashanti in the Volta Region. I am dark in complexion, I have a round face and a pointed nose. I am a teacher cum volunteer at Friends of Adaklu. I love cracking jokes and telling my students stories. My favorite subject is Mathematics. I taught in Matse E. P primary school for a year.  
  I am also a calm and respectful person. My hardworking and friendliness make me popular among my family and friends. I do not usually make friends so the few ones I have, I try hard to keep them. 
  My parents are Mawufemor Sakre and Albert Leh. They both come from Kpoeta in the Volta region. My mother is a petty trader while my father is a carpenter. They are both hardworking. I have only one sibling who is older than me. 
  My best friends are my students. My favorite game is football. I donâ€™t have a pet. My favorite food is fufu with light soup.
